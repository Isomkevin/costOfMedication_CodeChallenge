# Mylosis Medication Cost Calculator

## Challenge Statement
Python's fun:ðŸ˜€
Dr Dottel is an expert in treating mylosis disease. She administers 4 tablets for pain relief every day to each of her infected patients. She knows that patients with this disease cannot live beyond 90 years.

Assume that each table costs Kshs 1799.65;

Write a simple program which could be used  to compute the cost
of medication for this critical tablets if a patient lives to be be 90 years.

Note.
1 year  =  365 days
Patient1 is  78 years
Patient2 is 12 years


## Introduction
This document explains a simple Python program designed to compute the cost of medication for patients suffering from mylosis disease. Dr. Dottel, an expert in treating mylosis, administers four tablets for pain relief to each infected patient every day. The program calculates the total cost of medication for a patient if they live up to 90 years. 

## Problem Description
- Dr. Dottel administers four tablets of medication daily to patients suffering from mylosis.
- Each tablet costs Kshs 1799.65.
- Patients with mylosis cannot live beyond 90 years.
- 1 year is considered to have 365 days.

## Solution
The program computes the medication cost based on the age of the patient provided:
1. Accepts the age of the patient as input.
2. Calculates the total number of days the patient is expected to live (90 years * 365 days).
3. Computes the total number of tablets required (4 tablets/day * total number of days).
4. Multiplies the total tablets by the cost of each tablet to determine the total medication cost.
